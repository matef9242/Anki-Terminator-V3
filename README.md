[ add-on code : `1428126516` ]<br> 

#### [ ‚ñ≤ Attention ]
 This add-on stores your login information in a Cookie.<br>
 If you are concerned about security, please do not use this add-on.<br>
(To delete the cookie, delete the add-on or delete the User_files folder.)<br>

*  Advantages of using cookie
    * No need for tedious 2-step authentication
    * Free AI can be used as much as you want (no need for API)
<br>
*  Disadvantages of using cookie 
    * Poor security
    * Add-on is easily broken<br>

To resolve this cookie issue, API is needed (in short, it will be paid for).<br>
I have not yet developed the function to use the API.<br>

#### [ Limits of each AI ]<br>
 * **Chat GPT**
    * The fastest, but has an hourly limit<br>
 (30 times per hour, so about 1 time every 2 minutes), <br>
 so if you use it continuously, it will reach the limit soon.
 * **Google Bard** 
    * Unlimited number of replies, but replies are a bit slow.
 * **Bing Chat** 
    * 30 chats per session and 300 chats per day, but GPT-4 is free.
<br>

 #### [ How to Use ]

I'm about to write it, please wait a bit.<br>


#### [ ‚ñ≤ Known Issues ]
* Auto-Prompt does not work in Bing Chat.
* Mac Anki23.12.1 cannot open Bird and Bing, but Mac23.12 can. <br>
This problem is a Qt issue, so perhaps the latest Anki update will fix it when Qt is updated. 
* Menu items not neat and tidy.
* Translated texts in the options are choppy.
* Translated texts in the options are incorrect.
* Not yet tested on older Anki.
